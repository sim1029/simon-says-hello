# Simon Says Hello

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b654c94e-08a6-4b79-b443-7837581b1d8d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms-ci/deploys)

## **Description**

T﻿his website is mainly for myself since I have a horrible memory when it comes to all the progress I have made as a developer. However I encourage you to poke around my personal site to better understand what I am passionate about, where I got my experience from, and what skills I bring to the table.

## **Skills Utilized**

* G﻿atsby.js
* R﻿eact.js
* N﻿etlify
* G﻿ithub
* T﻿ailwindCSS
* E﻿SLint
* P﻿rettier
* D﻿ecapCMS

## **Contribution**

I﻿ developed this project from scratch to be a custom CMS for whatever I wanted the world to know about me.

## **Key Takeaways**

I﻿ would not choose Gatsby as a framework to build websites again (bad abstractions do exist). Stay focused on one task at a time. With this project I often picked it up and then left it off again before finally sitting down and completing it. Work invested up front is worth it in the long run.
