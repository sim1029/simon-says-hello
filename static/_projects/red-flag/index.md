# Red Flag

## **Description**

This is an ongoing enterprise between myself and another friend from the University of Pittsburgh.
We aim to create a platform that serves crowdsourced information about a person that a dating profiles do not include.
This backpage of dating profiles will allow individuals to plan safer interactions with strangers on the internet.

The repository for this project and the site itself are still under development and therefore not publicly availible.
