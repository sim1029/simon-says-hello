# S﻿imon Says Hello v1

## **Description**

C﻿heck out the previous version of my portfolio website. I built it to look and feel like an Apple app store clone completely with bootstrap. The content is largely outdated but some of the projects listed on it are not included on the current version of my website so check it out!

## **Skills Utilized**

* H﻿TML
* C﻿SS
* B﻿ootstrap

## **Contribution**

Created the website from scratch with the vision to have a personal website that is an app store clone.

## **Key Takeaways**

F﻿irst, having your personal website be one super long HTML file is not ideal. It is difficult find what I am looking for and add/edit the content on the website. Furthermore, I would like to have additional features that raw HTML and CSS would not have supported. However I was able to throw up the site quickly which was an advantage.

### Further Information

T﻿his was the initial version of my new portfolio website (Simon Says Hello). I encourage you to compare the sites.
