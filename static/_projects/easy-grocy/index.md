# Easy Grocy

## **Description**

R﻿eact Native application which tracks inventory of food for households to determine which items belong to each person and when they will reach their expiration date.

## **Role**

H﻿ad idea for project, coded front end, and coached beginner hackers on team.

## **Skills Utilized**

* R﻿eact Native
* F﻿lask
* P﻿ython
* P﻿ublic Speaking

## **Contribution**

I﻿ created the React Native shell for our project that communicated with our Flask API. Additionally, I coached a beginner hacker on our team and presented the final project to the judges at Steelhacks.

## **Outcome**

F﻿irst place project in the beginner track

## **Key Takeaways**

T﻿rying to build a generalized application which will work accross platforms is difficult and often times will lead to a mediocre experience on each platform. Creating best in class native versions of software when possible is more ideal. Get something working well for a single platform before trying to include each device out there (Android, iPhone, Laptop, TV...)
