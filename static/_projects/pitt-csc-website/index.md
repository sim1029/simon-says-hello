L﻿ead Developer

## **Contribution**

C﻿ommunicated with officer team to keep content like officer info, event schedule, and general club information up to date. Performed updates on software packages with vulnerabilities and fixed minor UI bugs.

## **Outcome**

Gave officers more time to focus on club administrative work by offloading brunt of commonly asked questions to Pitt CSC website.

## **Key Takeaways**
