## Meet Simon!

Hi there üëã , my name is Simon Schueller. I am twenty one years old and I am from Ormond Beach, Florida but I lived in Pittsburgh for over a decade so of course I am a Steelers, Pens and Pirates fan üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è.

I just finished my undergrad studying CS here at Pitt and will be completing my master's degree (also in CS) in Spring 2024. I just hope that AI doesn't replace all programmers by then.... This past summer I worked as a software engineer for Capital One at their headquarters in Mclean Virginia, I absolutely love the NOVA area. After this excursion to India, I will be shipping off to NYC to do more work for Capital One as a software engineer on one of their Machine Learning teams. This is definitely going to be the most eventful summer of my life and I am beyond excited to begin!

This summer I will be joining some fellow Pitt students on the **[Leadership in the Himalayas](https://www.abroad.pitt.edu/leadership)** Panther Program. Although I only heard about the program from one of my roommates the day that applications were due, (shout out Bryan for letting me interview late for the program) this program is perfect for me. Hiking the Himalayan mountains for two weeks sounds like a dream come true. Growing up, some of my fondest memories have been multiple day backpacking excursions in rural Pennsylvania and Virginia. I am no stranger to living off just what I can carry and sleeping on the ground. But more so, I am a lifelong learner interested to get out of my comfort zone and work to become the best leader I can in life. I hope to leave this experience with new perspectives of both leadership and cultures different from my own. Oh, and lots of pictures too, don't worry mom. Ok, I really need to go start packing now, can't wait to document the rest of our reflections/adventures üèî
